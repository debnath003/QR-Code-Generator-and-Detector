# QR-Code-Generator-and-Detector

This is a Python project where I tried making a QR Code Generator and QR Code Detector both under one code using tkinter module, qrcode module, and opencv module in Python. It is a fully working GUI-based python project where we can generate a QR Code for any website link, any name, or any text; it generates all the QR Codes in .png image file format; though we can generate it also in .jpg, .svg or in .jpeg format, for the time being, I kept it in .png file only! :)

The QR Code Detector detects the message of the QR Code consisting of when I give it from any folder. It can check different files and can render a wrong message when a QR Code image is not given and an invalid image is given.

I referred to https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-qr-code-generator-and-reader-tkinter-python for creating this project, and extensively used the tkinter, opencv, and qrcode libraries for making this project. 

Hope this helps others, I believe! üòÅ
