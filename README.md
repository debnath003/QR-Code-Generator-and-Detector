# QR-Code-Generator-and-Detector

This is a Python project where I tried making a QR Code Generator and QR COde Detector both under one code using tkinter module, qrcode module and opencv module in Python. It is a fully working GUI-based python project where we can generate a QR Code of any website link, any name or any text; it generates all the QR Codes in .png image file format; though we can generate it also in .jpg, .svg or in .jpeg format, for the timebeing I kept it in .png file only! :)

The QR Code Detector detects the message of the QR Code consisting of when I give it from any folders. It can check different files and can render a wrong message when QR Code image is not given and an invalid image is given.

I referred to https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-qr-code-generator-and-reader-tkinter-python for creating this project, hope this helps others I believe! üòÅ
